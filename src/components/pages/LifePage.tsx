            Throughout my life, math had been a very crucial component in
            everything. From everyday basic tasks and through every stage of my
            education,{" "}
            <span className="bold">math could be found anywhere I go to</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting from elementary when I thoughts of maths as a fun game
            where I would just write the number, put in a few plus or minus
            signs and see and calculate what it would add up to, those were good
            days when things were simple. <InvertBypass>üò°</InvertBypass>

          <p>
            In early years of highschool, I had struggled with math since many
            concepts were far too difficult for me to understand I couldn't
            catch up, although it proved itself to me to very helpful in many of
            my hobbies such as{" "}
            <span className="bold">video gaming and cooking.</span> I would plan
            out how much of something I would need and execute it out whether it
            would be my game quest or measuring ingredients, and all of this
            could be thanks to math.

          <p>
            Now that I have started university and had lived alone for a period
            math had help me accomplished many basic tasks and needs. and with
            my passion toward computer science, I was able incorporate many more
            of the advance concept that was taught in school, and into my games
            and websites projects such as this!
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall math is great for what I do!{" "}
